\section{Communication complexity}

\begin{definition}
   KW games. In our games Alice always speaks first.
\end{definition}


\begin{definition}
    The width of a $k$ round protocol is the length of the longest message.
\end{definition}



\begin{theorem}
The length of the shortest protocol solving $KW_f$ is exactly equal to the depth of the smallest circuit computing $f$.
\end{theorem}

 


\begin{theorem}
If $KW_f$ game can not be solved by a $k$ protocol of width $w$ then $f$ can not be solved by a circuit of size $2^w$.
\end{theorem}

We want to focus on KW games for compositions of functions: 

\begin{definition}
   
   
   Suppose $f$ and $g$ are a functions on $n$ and $m$ input respectively. Then $f \circ g$ is a function on $nm$ inputs:  
   
   \[(f \circ g)(x_{1,1}, \dots , x_{n,m}) = f( g(x_{1,1}, \dots x_{1,m}), \dots,  g(x_{n,1}, \dots x_{n,m}) )\]
   
   
\end{definition}

We present the following conjecture:

\begin{conjecture}
   Suppose that there is no $d_1$ round protocol for $KW_f$ of width $w_1$ and also that there is no $d_2$ round protocol for $KW_g$ (or for $KW_{\neg g}$ if $d_1$ is even) of width $w_2$. Then there is no $d_1+d_2-1$ round protocol of width $min(w_1,w_2)$.
\end{conjecture}

To complement it we can actually show a way to combine the protocols for $KW_f$ and $KW_g$:


\begin{lemma}
   Suppose that there is a $d_1$ round protocol for $KW_f$ of width $w_1$ and also that there is a $d_2$ round protocol for $KW_g$ (or for $KW_{\neg g}$ if $d_1$ is even)  of width $w_2$. Then there is a $d_1+d_2-1$ round protocol of width $max(w_1,w_2+log(n))$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
    Execute promised protocol for $KW_f$. The last message can always assumed to be of length $\leq log(n)$, as the speaking player can just tell the coordinate where they differ. Then they can start executing the protocol for $KW_g$ or $KW_{\neg g}$ starting with the same player who was speaking last during the first protocol. The length of the first $d_1-1$ messages is at most $w_1$, length of $d_1$-th message is at most $w_2+log(n)$, and the length of thh last $d_2-1$ message is at most $w_2$. Which gives us the desired result.
\end{proof}
