\section{Introduction}

The main goal of this project is to develop new approach to proving formula lower bounds. The current state of the art is the result from \cite{hastad1986almost}:

\begin{theorem}

 There are no depth $d$ circuit computing Parity of size $2^{\alpha n^{\frac{1}{d-1}}}$ for some $\alpha>0$.

\end{theorem}

This result was proven using random restrictions technique. One of the defining characteristics of it is that it is inherently "bottom-up". Attempts to implement "top-down" approach have seen limited success: the only results we are aware are coming from \cite{haastad1995top,meir2017prediction}:

\begin{theorem}
There are no depth $3$ circuit computing Majority of size $2^{\alpha \sqrt{n}}$ for some $\alpha>0$.
\end{theorem}

We are planning to answer the following open problem from \cite{haastad1995top}:

\begin{open_problem}

Prove by top-down argument $2^{n^{\epsilon}}$ lower bound for depth $4$ circuits for some explicit function for some $\epsilon>0$.

\end{open_problem}
